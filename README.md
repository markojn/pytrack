# object-oriented python particle pusher for ALPHA

First commit (02-08-2017)
An untested track generator for fully axisymmetric geometries.

Some notes about the current version:
- This version doesn't yet have a postprocessor component, and so simulation accuracy hasn't yet been thoroughly tested.
User beware!
